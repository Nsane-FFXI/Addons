  Ran out of Tools or Ammo.
  You've completed an Trial.
  Luopan was Destroyed.
  Trying to use something while medicated.
  Multiple dispel, for basically RDM Neck... If you only dispel on buff it will tell you which buff it was.

Some thing that are in there that have been blocked commented out because of annoyance,
  Stoneskin... WHM cure solace.
  Dia... You will hear it land on you but not the mob. Seem to be most peoples pulling or tagging spell.
  Flash... PLD Tanks.

*** Obviously You can comment out anything you dislike or find annoying ***

The only thing that will trigger an audible call-out is with in your party, not alliance, you can make this alliance wide by changing line 40 from "if g == 1 then" to "if g == 1 or 2 or 3 then"
You will hearing buffs like Song/Roll/Buffs being removed that you place on others, one person did not like this so there is a blocked comment on line 152, if you would like this comment line 151 and uncomment line 152.
